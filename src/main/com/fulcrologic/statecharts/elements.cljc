  "The elements you can define in charts. The intention is for this model to be potentially serializable for users
   that need that. Thus, the expressions used in these data structures *MAY* use CLJC functions/code, or may represent
   such elements a strings or other (quoted) EDN. The ExecutionModel is responsible for this part of the interpretation.

   The overall data model is represented as a map. The DataModel implementation MAY choose scope and resolution
   rules. Location expressions are interpreted by the DataModel, but it is recommended they be keywords or vectors

(defn invoke
  "Create an instance of an external service that can return data (and send events) back to the calling state(s). An
  invoked service stays active while the state is active, and is terminated when the parent state is exited.

  When the invocation is created it will be associated with the identifier `<state-id>.<platform-id>` where `<state-id>`
  is the ID of the state in which the invocation lives, and `<platform-id>` is a unique autogenerated id. This is
  stored in `idlocation` (if supplied) in the data model. This identifier is known as the `invokeid`.

  Events generated by the invoked service will cause `finalize` to be called (if supplied). Note that each event causes
  this, and `finalize` MAY update the data model. Such processing happens before the event is handed to the rest of
  the state machine for evaluation.

  A `:done.invoke.<invokeid>` event is generated if the invoked service reaches a final state and exits.

  If the state of the (local) machine is exited before receiving the done event, then it cancels the invoked service
  and ignores any events received by it after that point.

  * `:id` The id of the element. See below for special considerations.
  * `:params` A map from parameter name to expression in the execution model's notation. E.g. `{:x (fn [env data] 42)}`
  * `:namelist` A map from parameter name to location path. E.g. `{:x [:ROOT :k]}`
  * `:src` A literal URI to be passed to the external service.
  * `:srcexpr` An expression in the execution model's notation to calculate a URI to be passed to the external service.
  * `:finalize` A stand-in for the `expr` parameter on a nested `script` element.  i.e. this is a shorthand for
                nesting a `(finalize {} (script {:expr=<this value>}))`.
  * `:type` A static value for the type of external service. Defaults to statechart, which is equivalent to the URI
            'http://www.w3.org/TR/scxml/'. Implementations may choose platform-specific interpretations of this argument.
  * `:typeexpr` An expression version of `:type`. Use your ExecutionModel to run the expression to get the type.
  * `:autoforward` Enable forwarding of (external) events to the invoked process.
  * `:idlocation` a location (i.e. vector of keywords) that specifies a location in the DataModel
                  to store a generated ID that uniquely identifies the invocation instance.

   NOTES:

   * The `id` *can* be supplied. If it is, then it will be the session id of an invoked chart. The specification
     says that you should specify one or the other, but this implementation allows you to specify both. If you
     don't supply an id, then an auto-generated one will be made for you.
   ** If `idlocation` AND `id` are supplied, then your ID is honored, AND stored at the given location.
   ** If ONLY `idlocation` then an autogenerated ID will be
     made for the chart's session ID as a string of <parent-state-id>.<genid> and stored there.
   ** If ONLY `id` is given, then that will be the session id of the invoked chart.
   ** If neither are given, then an id will be generated, but not stored, and there is no guaranteed value of the id.

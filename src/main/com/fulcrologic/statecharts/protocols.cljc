  "Protocols for the various pluggable bits of this library:

   Processor - A state machine processing algorithm. See com.fulcrologic.statecharts.algorithms.
   EventQueue - An external event queue for cross (and loopback) communication of machines and external services.
   DataModel - A model for saving/fetching data that can be directly manipulated by a state machine.
   ExecutionModel - A component that implements the interpretation of runnable code in the machine.
   InvocationProcessor - A component that knows how to invoke a specific kind of thing.
   StatechartRegistry - A component that can register/retrieve statechart definitions by their name.
   WorkingMemoryStore - A component that can save/restore the working memory of a session.

   Many methods in the namespace take an `env`. This map will contain keys for the above.

   The data model requires a *processing* env, which is the same as above, but also includes a volatile
   holding the working memory, context information, and the full statechart definition (e.g. from the
   registry).

   See `com.fulcrologic.statecharts.specs`.

   The `env` is allowed to contain any number of user-defined (namespaced) keys.

(defprotocol DataModel
  "A data model for a state machine. Note that this protocol requires the *processing* env, which will

  (update! [provider processing-env {:keys [ops]}]
    "Run a sequence of operations that updates/removes data from the data model in the context of `env`.

     `opts` is a vector of data model changes.

     A DataModel implementation MUST support at least the following operations (where `path` can be a keyword or
     a vector of keywords, and value is any safely-serializable value):

     ```
     [{:op :assign :data {path1 value1 path2 value2}} ; overwrite (merge) the given path(s) with values
      {:op :delete :paths [path ...]}]                ; Remove the given items by key-path.

     See `data-model.operations` for helper functions/wrappers.

     Paths have a DataModel-specific interpretation.

     NOTE: ExecutionModel is used in contexts where the data model may need to be updated. In those contexts
     one may call the methods on the data model directly, or the execution model may allow a return value of the
     expression to act as the data model change.

    "Put a send-request on the queue.

     The send request has:

     * :event - (REQUIRED) The name of the message to be sent
       may describe the supported data types an event may contain.
     * :send-id - The id of the send element or an id customized by an expression on that element.
                  Need not be unique. Cancelling via this send-id cancels all undelivered events with that
                  send-id/source-session-id.
     * :invoke-id - The id of the invocation, if this event is coming from a child statechart.
     * :source-session-id - The globally unique session ID.
     * :data (OPTIONAL) The data to include (encode into) in the event. The state chart processor will extract this
                        data from the Data Model according to the `send` content elements or `namelist` parameter.
                        The event queue MAY use the `type` in order to decide how to encode this data for transport
                        to the `target`. The default is to simply leave the event data as the raw EDN assembled by
                        the state chart's send element. See your event queue's documentation for specifics.
     * :target - The target for the event.
                 Implementations of event queues may choose to use a URI format for target, or other shortcuts based
                 on `type`.
                 OPTIONAL: If not supplied, then the target is the `source-session-id` (the sender).
     * :type - The transport mechanism of the event. This may be a URI or other
               implementation-dependent value. OPTIONAL: The default is to deliver to other state chart sessions.
     * :delay - The number of ms to wait before delivering the event. Implementations MAY accept other formats,
                such as strings or tuples with units like `[4 :minutes]`.

     This function MAY fire the event off to an external service, in which case it can provide a mechanism for
     processing and delivering results/responses back to this queue for consumption by the sender.

     In this case the send isn't actually going *into* this event queue, but is instead being processed as described in
     SCXML standard's Event I/O Processor.

     Returns true if the event can be sent, and false if the type of event isn't supported.")
  (cancel! [event-queue env session-id send-id]
    "Cancel the (delayed) send(s) with the given `send-id` that were `sent!` by `session-id`.
     This is only possible for events that have a delay and have not yet been delivered.")
  (receive-events! [event-queue env handler] [event-queue env handler options]
    "Pull the next event(s) from the queue that can be delivered and run them through `handler`,
     which is a `(fn [env event])`.

     The `options` of the handler are defined by the queue implementation.

     For example, a queue capable of a transactional nature (say, implemented with an SQL database)
     might pass the database connection to the handler so it can participate in the transaction that was used to
     pull the event from the queue as part of the algorithm to ensure exactly-once event delivery.

     The format of `message` will depend on the `type` used in the `send`. For statechart session events, these should
     be in the format created by `events/new-event`, but MAY include
     any additional (preferably namespaced) keys to pass along.

     This function MAY block waiting for the next event. Your selected event queue implementation's
     documentation should be consulted for the correct way to run your event loop.

     If `handler` throws (or never returns, for example due to a server reboot) then the
     implementation SHOULD redeliver the event at a later time. This allows for things like system interruptions that
     cause unexpected exceptions that should be retried in the future.

     A proper implementation of an event queue should have IN ORDER and EXACTLY ONCE semantics for event delivery.
     In order to facilitate this your `handler` function SHOULD finish as quickly as possible (milliseconds) but MUST NOT
     exceed 5 seconds of run time. If this time limit is exceeded then an implementation MAY revert to
     AT LEAST ONCE delivery guarantees, though it MUST preserve event order.

     As such, statechart machines that use a durable event queue in a distributed environment should be defensively written
     to safely tolerate AT LEAST ONCE message delivery. For example, instead of using a `toggle` event to switch
     between two states give each a unique name (like `turn-on` and `turn-off`)."))

    This method MUST return the value of the expression, and it MUST also support expressions that need to update
    the data model. If the execution model is imperative, this can be support for imperative statements. If the
    expression model is functional, then typically the return value of the expression can be used.

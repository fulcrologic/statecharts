(ns com.fulcrologic.statecharts.runtime
  "This ns provides utility functions for working with a statecharts runtime environment, where you have some
   number of statecharts running using the setup defined as a statechart env. Note that a statechart env is
   a map that defines a statechart system's environment: That is to say the processing algorithm,
   event queue, the working memory store, the invocation processor, the execution model, and the data model. All of
   these components are pluggable.

   This namespace also assumes that you are doing the *recommended* (but not required) step of using a working memory
   store and event queue via those protocols (the algorithm can also be used as a pure function).

   So, the functions in this namespace that ask for an ::sc/env (see the function definition) require that such
   both of those are provided.

   The `env` INSIDE of statechart lambdas is known as a *processing environment*. A *processing environment* IS
   a system env that ALSO contains keys relating to the current execution context. Such a map can be used with
   these functions as well (in other words these functions work both outside AND inside of a statechart),
   though they assume you're passing a processing environment (and ignore the processing keys)."

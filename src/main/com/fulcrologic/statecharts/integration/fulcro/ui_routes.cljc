(defn istate
  "A state is a routing state that invokes a statechart on the target component. The `target` is any registry-compatible
   key, and that component in question must have an ro/statechart or ro/statechart-id option to designate which statechart
   will be invoked. The ro/statechart will be registered under the keyword version of `target`.

   The `:fulcro/actors` in the statechart's data model will have :actor/component set to the target itself. The target
   will be initialized like it is for `rstate` (see ro/initialize, etc.).

   This state will auto-route to the target. The additional options are:

   * target: The component registry key of the component that is the route target, and has the co-located statechart (or statechart-id).
      The :actor/component on the invoked chart will be this component, and the ident will be derived from the initialization
      of state (e.g. ro/initialize). See the initialization for `rstate` for details.
   * invoke-params: A map of params to be merged into the invoke `params`
   * finalize: Same as the option on `invoke`
   * autofoward: Same as the option on `invoke`
   * on-done: A (fn [env data & rest] ops) that will be run IF the invoked statechart hits a final state.
   * exit-target: A state ID which will be transitioned to IF the invoked statechart hits a final state.
   * statechart-id: A registered statechart id. Can be used instead of, or to override the component's co-located chart/id.
   * child-session-id: If supplied, this will be the invoked chart's session ID (instead of an autogenerated one)

   The remaining keys in the props are kept for the top-level emitted state.

   The session ID of the invoked chart will be at data location `[:invocation/id target-key]` of the routing session
   (see uir/session-id), where `target-key` is the `:route/target`'s registry keyword. Use `send-to-self!` to
   send events to the component's chart.

   The invoked component should specify an ro/idlocation so that events can be sent to it from within.

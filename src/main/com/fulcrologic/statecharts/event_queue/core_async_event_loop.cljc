(ns com.fulcrologic.statecharts.event-queue.core-async-event-loop
  "A queue that uses core.async to enable support for delayed events and also provides a `run-event-loop!` mechanism
   for automatically processing events as they arrive (optional). You may, of course, send the queue the
   `evts/cancel-event` to exit your machine (without reaching the final state) to cause the `run-event-loop!` to
   exit.

   This queue can support any number of running statecharts via their session-ids. `send!` will reject any request that
   is missing a target that defines the target session-id. Just use the same instance as the event queue for every
   chart."

(defn run-event-loop!
  "Initializes a new session using `sp/start!` on the processor and assigns it `session-id`.
   Then runs a continuous loop polling the event-queue for new events and processing them.

   `wmem-atom` is an atom that will be updated with the latest working memory of the state
   machine, and allows you to look at the state of it from outside.  It is safe to read the active states
   from ::sc/configuration of the working memory, but you should leverage the data-model protocol for
   interfacing with the data a machine might need to see or manipulate.

   Runs a core.async loop that will run `receive-events!` at the given time resolution.

   Returns an atom containing a boolean that is what keeps the event loop running. If you swap that atom to `false` then
   the event loop will exit."
